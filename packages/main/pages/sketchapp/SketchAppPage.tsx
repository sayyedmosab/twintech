Too much typing gets to my fingers. So back to the old ways of drag and drop. SketchApp has all the basic components to create the striucture and rough out each page. 

And then as I went on, it did end up havign a few "advanced" features if thats what you want to call them. Anyhow, this is a free tool, a gift to my generation still kicking it!

Just register so I know who is who... and you can play around all you want. Enjoy`}
